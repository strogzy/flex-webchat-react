# Custom UI for Twilio Flex webchat (using standard webchat channel)
A simple UI in React that follows the same flow as Flex Webchat widget and sends a chat into Twilio Flex.

Using this blog as basis for the UI: https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/10/chat-interfaces-react-javascript.html 

## Get started:
- Clone repo
- copy `src/config.js.example` to `src/config.js` and add your account SID and FlexFlowSID
- `yarn` or `npm install` to install the dependencies
- `yarn start` or `npm start` to start the dev server



## ToDo
- Fix side of the conversation (Me, vs other participants)


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
